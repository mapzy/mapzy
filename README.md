# Mapzy

![The Mapzy logo with the Mapzy text on its right side. The logo looks like an abstract folded paper map.](https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy/assets/1881676/ea377137-3f4a-43b2-adfd-1e049128a338)

## A free, simple, self-hostable, and privacy-friendly store finder.

## Mapzy Intro Video
The best way to see how Mapzy works it to check out this screencast that runs you through the basics:

## Here are a few screenshots:
A public map that you can embed. You can also customize the colours of the pins and buttons.

A detailed view of a location shows up when you click on a pin:

A list of locations shows up when you click on the list button on the bottom left:

The intuitive and WYSIWYG admin interface let's you add, edit and delete locations along with their opening times without much fuss:

You can simply embed your map anywhere you want and control some of its behaviour via URL params:

In the settings, you can adjust your colours and turn on Sync Mode if you want to manage your locations via the Mapzy API:
