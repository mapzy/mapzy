  Hello there  ðŸ‘‹
</p>
<p>
  Your trial is over and we have deactivated your account.
  If you have embedded your map on your website, it's now no longer available.<br>
  If you want to continue using Mapzy, make sure to subscribe to
  <a href="<%= dashboard_account_settings_url %>">one of our plans</a>.<br><br>

  Unless you tell us otherwise or delete your account, we'll keep your map and
  locations for one year. Just subscribe to pick up where you left off.<br><br>

  If you didn't get enough time and would like to extend your trial,
  or have any other questions, let us know by replying to this email.

  Best regards,<br>
