Hello there
Your trial is over and we have deactivated your account.
If you have embedded your map on your website, it's now no longer available.

If you want to continue using Mapzy, make sure to subscribe to one of our plans here:

Unless you tell us otherwise or delete your account, we'll keep your map and locations for one year. Just subscribe to pick up where you left off.

If you didn't get enough time and would like to extend your trial, or have any other questions, let us know by replying to this email.

Best regards
Sag and Can from Mapzy
